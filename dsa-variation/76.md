### **Problem Statement**

You are given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals`, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]` and start<endstart < end. You are also given an integer `k`, which represents the number of meetings a person can attend simultaneously.

Your task is to determine if it is possible for the person to attend **all meetings** with the given constraint of being able to attend at most `k` meetings at the same time.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [4, 6], [7, 8]]
k = 2
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
True
```

#### Explanation:

1. The person can attend at most `k = 2` meetings simultaneously.
2. Overlaps:
    - `[1, 3]` overlaps with `[2, 5]`.
    - `[2, 5]` overlaps with `[4, 6]`.
    - No more than 2 meetings overlap at the same time.
3. Therefore, it is possible to attend all meetings.

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6], [7, 8]]
k = 1
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
False
```

#### Explanation:

1. The person can attend at most `k = 1` meeting simultaneously.
2. Overlaps:
    - `[1, 4]`, `[2, 5]`, and `[3, 6]` overlap with each other.
    - At one point, 3 meetings overlap, which exceeds the limit of `k = 1`.
3. Therefore, it is not possible to attend all meetings.

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[10, 20], [20, 30], [30, 40]]
k = 1
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
True
```

#### Explanation:

1. The person can attend at most `k = 1` meeting at a time.
2. There are no overlaps between the meetings.
3. Therefore, it is possible to attend all meetings.

### **Constraints**

1. 1 ≤ `intervals.length` ≤ 10⁴
2. 0 ≤ `start`, `end` ≤ 10⁵
3. `start<endstart < end` for all intervals.
4. 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `intervals.length`
