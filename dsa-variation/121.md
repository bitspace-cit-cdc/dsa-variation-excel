### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`. Additionally, for any consecutive elements in the array (`ans[i]` and `ans[i+1]`), their absolute difference must not exceed 1.

### Input:
- An integer `n`

### Output:
- An array of integers `ans` of length `n + 1`
- Return null/empty array if the constraint of consecutive elements cannot be satisfied

### Examples:
1. 
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation: 
0 --> 0 (0 ones)
1 --> 1 (1 one)
2 --> 10 (1 one)
The absolute difference between any consecutive elements is at most 1.
```

2. 
```
Input: n = 4
Output: [0,1,1,2,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0 (0 ones)
1 --> 1 (1 one)
2 --> 10 (1 one)
3 --> 11 (2 ones)
4 --> 100 (1 one)
The absolute difference between any consecutive elements is at most 1.
```

3. 
```
Input: n = 6
Output: null
Explanation:
0 --> 0 (0 ones)
1 --> 1 (1 one)
2 --> 10 (1 one)
3 --> 11 (2 ones)
4 --> 100 (1 one)
5 --> 101 (2 ones)
6 --> 110 (2 ones)
This would result in [0,1,1,2,1,2,2] where |ans[3] - ans[4]| = |2-1| = 1 but |ans[4] - ans[5]| = |1-2| = 1 creates a sequence that violates the constraint of smooth transitions.
```

### Constraints:
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
- For any consecutive elements ans\[i\] and ans\[i+1\], |ans\[i\] - ans\[i+1\]| ≤ 1
- The solution should maintain the same time complexity as the original problem
