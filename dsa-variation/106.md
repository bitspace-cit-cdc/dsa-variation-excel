I'll modify this word break problem by adding new conditions while maintaining its dynamic programming nature and difficulty level.

### Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, and two integers `minWords` and `maxWords`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words meeting these conditions:
1. The total number of words used must be between `minWords` and `maxWords` (inclusive)
2. No word can be used more than twice in the segmentation
3. At least one word must start with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u)

---
### Input:
- String `s` 
- Array of strings `wordDict`
- Integer `minWords` representing minimum number of words required
- Integer `maxWords` representing maximum number of words allowed

### Output:
- Boolean indicating whether string can be segmented according to all conditions

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"], minWords = 2, maxWords = 3
Output: true
Explanation: "cat sand dog" is a valid segmentation using 3 words
It includes "and" which starts with a vowel
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"], minWords = 2, maxWords = 4
Output: false
Explanation: While "apple pen apple" is a valid segmentation, it uses "apple" more than twice
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code","let"], minWords = 1, maxWords = 2
Output: false
Explanation: While "leet code" is a valid segmentation with correct word count, no word starts with a vowel
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ wordDict.length ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ wordDict[i].length ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ minWords ≤ maxWords ≤ 20
- s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters
- All words in wordDict are unique
- Each word can be used at most twice
- At least one word in the segmentation must start with a vowel
- The segmentation must use between minWords and maxWords words
