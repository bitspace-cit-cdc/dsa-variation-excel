### **Problem Statement**

You are an adventurer tasked with completing a **circular treasure hunt**. Along the route, there are `n` treasure stations arranged in a circle, where the amount of treasure available at the i-th station is represented by `treasure[i]`.

Your journey, however, comes with a cost! It takes `cost[i]` units of energy to travel from the i-th station to the (i + 1)-th station. The route is circular, so the last station connects back to the first.

You have a magical vehicle that can carry **unlimited energy**, but you begin your journey with an empty energy reserve. At each station, you can collect the treasure available there and immediately use it as energy for your vehicle.

Your mission is to determine the **starting treasure station** (if any) where you can successfully complete the entire circular route in a **clockwise direction**, collecting treasure and using it for travel. If it's not possible to complete the route, return `-1`.

It is guaranteed that if a solution exists, it will be unique.

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq \text{treasure.length}, \text{cost.length} \leq 10^4$
2. $0 \leq \text{treasure[i]}, \text{cost[i]} \leq 10^4$
3. The solution is guaranteed to be unique if it exists.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
treasure = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
3
```

#### Explanation:

1. Starting at station `3` (0-indexed):
    - Collect `treasure[3] = 4`, travel to station `4` (cost `1`). Remaining energy: `4 - 1 = 3`.
    - Collect `treasure[4] = 5`, travel to station `0` (cost `2`). Remaining energy: `3 + 5 - 2 = 6`.
    - Collect `treasure[0] = 1`, travel to station `1` (cost `3`). Remaining energy: `6 + 1 - 3 = 4`.
    - Collect `treasure[1] = 2`, travel to station `2` (cost `4`). Remaining energy: `4 + 2 - 4 = 2`.
    - Collect `treasure[2] = 3`, travel to station `3` (cost `5`). Remaining energy: `2 + 3 - 5 = 0`.
2. The circuit is successfully completed starting at station `3`.

#### Input:

```plaintext
treasure = [2, 3, 4]
cost = [3, 4, 3]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
-1
```

#### Explanation:

1. Starting at any station results in running out of energy before completing the circuit.
2. Therefore, it's impossible to complete the journey.
