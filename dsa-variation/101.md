### Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, find the longest substring that becomes a palindrome after removing any one character from it. If no such substring exists, return the longest palindromic substring without any character removal.

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: String `s` containing lowercase letters only
- Output: Longest substring that becomes palindrome after removing at most one character

---
### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcba"
Output: "abcba"
Explanation: 
Already a palindrome, no need to remove any character

Example 2:
Input: s = "aabbcd"
Output: "aabb"
Explanation:
After removing 'c', "aabb" becomes "aabb"
Removing 'd' gives same length palindrome "aabb"

Example 3:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: "a"
Explanation: 
No substring becomes palindrome after one removal
Return longest palindrome of length 1
```

---
### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000
- String contains only lowercase English letters
- If multiple answers exist, return any one of them
