# Problem Statement:
You are given an array `points` representing coordinates of cell towers on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. Here, `ri` represents the signal strength radius of tower i. Two towers can communicate directly if their signal ranges overlap (i.e., the distance between them is less than or equal to the sum of their radii).
The cost of upgrading a tower's signal strength by 1 unit is 5. Your task is to find the minimum total upgrade cost needed so that all towers can communicate with each other through a network of overlapping signals (towers can relay signals to other towers they overlap with).

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: Array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` represents tower coordinates and signal radius
- Output: Integer representing minimum total cost of radius upgrades needed for all towers to connect

---
###  Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,0,2], [2,2,2], [3,10,5]]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
- Upgrade tower at [2,2] by 3 units (cost = 15)
- Now tower ranges overlap: [0,0] overlaps with [2,2], which overlaps with [3,10]
- All towers can communicate through signal relays

Example 2:
Input: points = [[0,0,1], [2,2,1], [4,4,1], [6,6,1]]
Output: 30
Explanation:
- Upgrade each tower's radius by 1.5 units (cost = 6 * 5 = 30)
- Creates a chain of overlapping signals connecting all towers
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ points.length ≤ 1000
- points[i].length == 3
- -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000
- All coordinates are integers
- Radius upgrades must be made in increments of 0.5 units
- Maximum possible upgrade is 10 units per tower
