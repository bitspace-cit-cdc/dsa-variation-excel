### **Problem Statement**

You are a game designer creating a strategy game where players defend territories on a battlefield grid. The battlefield is represented as an `m x n` matrix `board` containing the letters:

- `'D'` representing **defended territory**,
- `'U'` representing **undefended territory**.

A **region** is formed by connecting all adjacent `'U'` cells **horizontally or vertically**. A region is considered **captured** if it is completely surrounded by `'D'` cells, and **none of the region's cells are on the edge** of the battlefield (matrix).

Your task is to identify and capture all such **undefended regions** by replacing all `'U'` cells in these regions with `'D'`. The operation must be performed **in-place** on the original battlefield grid.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D'],
  ['D', 'U', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'D', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'U', 'D', 'D']
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D'],
  ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D'],
  ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D'],
  ['D', 'U', 'D', 'D']
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The region of `'U'` cells in the center (connected as a cluster) is surrounded by `'D'` cells, so it is captured.
- The single `'U'` at the bottom edge is not surrounded and remains uncaptured.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['D', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'D', 'D']
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['D', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'U', 'D'],
  ['D', 'D', 'D']
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The `'U'` cells are connected but are not surrounded because they touch the edge of the battlefield, so no regions are captured.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['U', 'U'],
  ['U', 'U']
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
board = [
  ['U', 'U'],
  ['U', 'U']
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The entire battlefield is made of `'U'` cells and touches the edges, so no regions can be captured.

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq m, n \leq 200$
2. `board[i][j]` is either `'D'` or `'U'`.
3. A region is formed by connecting `'U'` cells horizontally or vertically.
4. A region is considered surrounded only if it is fully enclosed by `'D'` cells and none of its cells are on the edge of the board.
5. The operation must be performed **in-place** on the input grid.
