### Problem Statement:

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon has two properties:
1. A number painted on it represented by array `nums`
2. A color represented by array `colors` where `colors[i]` is either 'R', 'G', or 'B'

When bursting balloons, you must follow these rules:
1. If you burst the `ith` balloon:
   * You get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins if all three balloons are the same color
   * You get `nums[i - 1] + nums[i] + nums[i + 1]` coins if all three balloons are different colors
   * You get `nums[i]` coins if neither of above conditions is met
2. You cannot burst two balloons of the same color consecutively
3. You must burst at least one balloon of each color
4. After bursting k balloons, you must have burst at least ⌊k/3⌋ balloons of each color

Return *the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely*.

### Input:
- Integer array `nums` representing numbers on balloons
- Character array `colors` representing balloon colors
- Treat out-of-bounds indices as balloons with number 1 and color 'R'

### Output:
- Integer representing maximum coins possible

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8], colors = ['R','G','B','R']
Output: 20
Explanation: 
Burst order: G -> B -> R -> R
- Burst G(1): different colors R,G,B = 3+1+5 = 9 coins
- Burst B(5): different colors R,B,R = 3+5+8 = 16 coins
- Burst first R(3): same color R,R = 1*3*8 = 24 coins
- Burst last R(8): single balloon = 8 coins
Total = 57 coins
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,5], colors = ['R','R']
Output: 0
Explanation: Cannot burst all balloons as we can't burst same color consecutively
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], colors = ['R','G','B','G']
Output: 19
Explanation: Must maintain color balance throughout bursting
```

### Constraints:
- n == nums.length == colors.length
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 300
- 0 ≤ nums\[i\] ≤ 100
- colors\[i\] is either 'R', 'G', or 'B'
- Must burst at least one balloon of each color
- Cannot burst same color balloons consecutively
- Must maintain color balance: after k bursts, each color ≥ ⌊k/3⌋
- Out-of-bounds treated as \[1,'R'\]
