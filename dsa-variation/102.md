## Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings that contain exactly one vowel. If a substring contains the same vowel multiple times, it counts as one vowel. A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: String `s` containing lowercase English letters
- Output: Number of palindromic substrings containing exactly one vowel

---

### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Palindromic substrings with one vowel:
- Length 1: "a", "a", "a" (3 substrings)
- Length 2: "aa", "aa" (2 substrings)
- Length 3: "aaa" (1 substring)
Total: 6 substrings

Example 2:
Input: s = "bceb"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Palindromic substrings with one vowel:
- Length 1: "e" (1 substring)
- Length 3: "cec" (1 substring)
- Length 4: "bceb" (1 substring)
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000
- s consists of lowercase English letters only
- Vowels are considered to be 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
- Multiple occurrences of same vowel count as one vowel
