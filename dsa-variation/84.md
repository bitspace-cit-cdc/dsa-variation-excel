### **Problem Statement**

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to split the string into the **minimum number of substrings**, such that each substring contains **no repeated characters**.

Return the **minimum number of substrings** required to satisfy this condition.

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 10^5$
2. `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

---

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
s = "abac"
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
2
```

#### Explanation:

1. Split the string into substrings `["ab", "ac"]`.
2. Each substring contains no repeated characters.
3. Minimum number of substrings: `2`.

---

#### Input:

```plaintext
s = "aaaaa"
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
5
```

#### Explanation:

1. Each character must be its own substring, as there are repeated characters in the string.
2. Split the string into substrings `["a", "a", "a", "a", "a"]`.
3. Minimum number of substrings: `5`.

---

#### Input:

```plaintext
s = "abcdef"
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
1
```

#### Explanation:

1. The entire string has no repeated characters.
2. No splitting is needed.
3. Minimum number of substrings: `1`.
