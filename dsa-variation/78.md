### **Problem Statement**

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the i-th interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` (inclusive). The **size** of an interval is defined as:

$\text{size} = \text{righti} - \text{lefti} + 1$

You are also given an integer array `queries`. For each query `queries[j]`, find the size of the **largest interval** `i` such that:

$\text{left[i]} \leq \text{queries[j]} \leq \text{right[i]}$

If no such interval exists for a query, return `-1`.

Return an array containing the answers for all queries.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 6], [8, 10]]
queries = [2, 3, 7, 9]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
[5, 5, -1, 3]
```

#### Explanation:

1. Query `2`: Overlaps with intervals `[1, 4]` and `[2, 6]`. The largest interval is `[2, 6]` with size `5`.
2. Query `3`: Overlaps with intervals `[1, 4]` and `[2, 6]`. The largest interval is `[2, 6]` with size `5`.
3. Query `7`: No interval contains `7`. Answer is `-1`.
4. Query `9`: Overlaps with interval `[8, 10]` with size `3`.

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[5, 10], [15, 20], [25, 30]]
queries = [7, 17, 12]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
[6, 6, -1]
```

#### Explanation:

1. Query `7`: Overlaps with interval `[5, 10]` with size `6`.
2. Query `17`: Overlaps with interval `[15, 20]` with size `6`.
3. Query `12`: No interval contains `12`. Answer is `-1`.

### **Constraints**

1. 1≤intervals.length≤1051 \leq \text{intervals.length} \leq 10^5
2. 1≤queries.length≤1051 \leq \text{queries.length} \leq 10^5
3. 1≤lefti,righti,queries[j]≤1091 \leq \text{lefti}, \text{righti}, \text{queries[j]} \leq 10^9
4. lefti≤righti\text{lefti} \leq \text{righti}
