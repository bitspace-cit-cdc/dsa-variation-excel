### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations, an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money, and two integers `minCoins` and `maxCoins`. Return *the number of combinations that make up that amount* subject to these conditions:
1. Each combination must use between `minCoins` and `maxCoins` coins (inclusive)
2. Each coin denomination must be used an odd number of times if it's prime, and an even number of times if it's composite
3. At least one denomination must be used more than twice

--

Input:
- Integer array `coins` representing coin denominations
- Integer `amount` representing target sum
- Integer `minCoins` representing minimum coins required
- Integer `maxCoins` representing maximum coins allowed

Output:
- Integer representing number of valid combinations
- Return 0 if no valid combination exists

Example 1:
```
Input: coins = [2,3,5], amount = 10, minCoins = 2, maxCoins = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Valid combinations:
1. 2+2+3+3 (4 coins, 2 used even times as composite, 3 used twice as prime)
2. 5+5 (invalid as no denomination is used more than twice)
```

Example 2:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 5, minCoins = 1, maxCoins = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Only valid combination is 1+1+1+1+1
- Uses 5 coins (within limits)
- 1 is used odd times (5) as it's prime
- One denomination used more than twice
```

Example 3:
```
Input: coins = [3,4], amount = 12, minCoins = 2, maxCoins = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: No valid combination exists that satisfies all conditions
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ coins.length ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 5000
- All values in coins are unique
- 0 ≤ amount ≤ 5000
- 1 ≤ minCoins ≤ maxCoins ≤ 20
- Prime denominations must be used odd number of times
- Composite denominations must be used even number of times
- At least one denomination must be used more than twice
- The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer
