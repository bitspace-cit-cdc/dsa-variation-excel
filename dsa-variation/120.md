### Problem Statement:
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return *an array* `ans` *of length* `n + 1` *such that for each* `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of binary patterns in `i` that satisfy:
1. Each pattern must be length `k`
2. Pattern must have more 1s than 0s
3. Pattern must not have two consecutive 1s
4. Pattern must start and end with different bits

Return -1 for each `i` where no such pattern exists.

---
### Input:
- Integer n (upper bound)
- Integer k (pattern length)

### Output:
- Integer array of length n+1 where ans[i] is the count of valid patterns in i

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, k = 3
Output: [-1,0,1,1,2,1]
Explanation: Let's examine each number's binary form:
0 = 000 [-1 as no valid pattern]
1 = 001 [0 valid patterns]
2 = 010 [1 valid pattern: 010]
3 = 011 [1 valid pattern: 011]
4 = 100 [2 valid patterns: 100, 101]
5 = 101 [1 valid pattern: 101]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: [-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: k=2 cannot have more 1s than 0s
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 7, k = 4
Output: [-1,0,1,1,2,2,3,2]
Explanation: Pattern must be length 4, start and end with different bits
```

### Constraints:
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
- 2 ≤ k ≤ 32
- Each pattern must be length k
- Pattern must have more 1s than 0s
- Pattern must not have consecutive 1s
- Pattern must start and end with different bits
- Return -1 if no valid pattern exists for a number
