### Problem Statement:
Given two strings s and t, and an integer k, return *the number of distinct* ***subsequences*** of s which equals t under these conditions:
1. Each selected subsequence must contain exactly k vowels
2. The characters in the subsequence must alternate between characters from the first half and second half of string s
3. If a character at index i is selected, you cannot select characters at i-1 and i+1 (non-adjacent rule)
4. The subsequence must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter

### Input:
- String s (source string)
- String t (target string)
- Integer k (required number of vowels)

### Output:
- Integer representing number of valid distinct subsequences
- Return 0 if no valid subsequence exists

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "bAabEcaB", t = "AaB", k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The only valid subsequence is "AaB":
- Contains 2 vowels (A,a)
- Alternates between first half "bAab" and second half "EcaB"
- Characters are non-adjacent in original string
- Contains both uppercase (A,B) and lowercase (a)
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rabbbiT", t = "raT", k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: While "raT" is a subsequence, it's invalid because:
- Cannot alternate between halves properly
Even though it has 1 vowel and mixed case
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "PrOgRaM", t = "PgM", k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: "PgM" is valid because:
- Contains 0 vowels as required
- Alternates between halves ("PrO" and "gRaM")
- Uses non-adjacent characters
- Has mixed case
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ t.length ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ k ≤ t.length
- s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters
- The subsequence must contain exactly k vowels
- Must alternate between characters from first and second half of s
- Cannot select adjacent characters from s
- Must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter
- The answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer
