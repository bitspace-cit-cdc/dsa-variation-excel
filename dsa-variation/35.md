### Merge K Sorted Linked Lists

You are tasked to merge **K sorted linked lists** into a single sorted linked list, with a **twist**:

1. Each of the `K` linked lists is sorted in ascending order.
2. Before merging, **skip every M-th node** in each linked list, where MM is a given integer.
3. The resulting merged linked list should contain the remaining nodes from all lists, sorted in ascending order.

### Problem Explanation:

1. **Input**:
    - An array of `K` sorted linked lists.
    - An integer MM representing the skipping frequency.
2. **Output**:
    - A single sorted linked list that merges all the input linked lists after **skipping every M-th node** in each list.
3. **Twist**:
    - For each linked list, traverse and skip every MM-th node before merging.
    - Nodes are considered skipped **before merging**, so the skipped nodes are not included in the final result.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
lists = [
    1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7,
    2 -> 6 -> 8 -> 9,
    3 -> 10 -> 12
]
M = 2
```

**Output:**

```
1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12
```

**Explanation:**

- First list: Skip the 2nd node (`4`). Remaining nodes: `[1, 5, 7]`.
- Second list: Skip the 2nd node (`6`). Remaining nodes: `[2, 8, 9]`.
- Third list: Skip the 2nd node (`10`). Remaining nodes: `[3, 12]`.
- Merge the remaining nodes: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12]`.

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
lists = [
    10 -> 20 -> 30,
    5 -> 15 -> 25,
    1 -> 2 -> 3
]
M = 1
```

**Output:**

```
[]
```

**Explanation:**

- M=1 means every node is skipped.
- After skipping, all lists are empty.
- The result is an empty list.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```
lists = [
    1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9,
    2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10
]
M = 3
```

**Output:**

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10
```

**Explanation:**

- First list: Skip the 3rd node (`5`). Remaining nodes: `[1, 3, 7, 9]`.
- Second list: Skip the 3rd node (`6`). Remaining nodes: `[2, 4, 8, 10]`.
- Merge the remaining nodes: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

### Constraints:

1. $0 \leq K \leq 10^4$ (number of linked lists).
2. $0 \leq N \leq 10^6$ (total number of nodes across all linked lists).
3. Node values are integers: $-10^4 \leq \text{node.value} \leq 10^4$.
4. $1 \leq M \leq N$.
