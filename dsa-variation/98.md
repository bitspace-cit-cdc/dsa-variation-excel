### Problem Statement:

You are given an array `stairs` where `stairs[i] = [cost, energy]`. The `cost` represents the monetary cost to use that step, and `energy` represents the energy points you gain/lose on that step (negative means you lose energy). You start with initial energy of `E` units. At each step, you can:
1. Climb one step using 2 energy units
2. Climb two steps using 5 energy units
3. Use an elevator (if available) using 0 energy units but costs additional $10
Elevators are available at indices marked in array `elevators`. You cannot proceed if your energy drops below 0.
Return the minimum cost path to reach the top while maintaining positive energy throughout the climb.

### Input and Output:
- Input: 
  - `stairs`: Array where `stairs[i] = [cost, energy]`
  - `E`: Initial energy
  - `elevators`: Array of indices where elevators are available
- Output: $[minCost, finalEnergy, path]$ or $[-1]$ if no valid path exists

### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: 
stairs = [[1,2], [4,-3], [2,1], [6,3], [4,-2]], 
E = 10,
elevators = [2]
Output: [13, 8, "1-2E-5"]
Explanation: 
- Start with 10 energy
- Climb one step: cost=1, energy=12 (10-2+4)
- Take elevator at index 2: cost=12 (1+1+10), energy=12
- Climb one step: cost=13, energy=8 (12-2-2)
Path encoded as steps taken with 'E' indicating elevator use

Example 2:
Input:
stairs = [[2,-1], [3,-2], [4,1], [3,-3]],
E = 5,
elevators = [1,3]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: Cannot maintain positive energy on any path

### Constraints:
- 2 ≤ stairs.length ≤ 1000
- -10 ≤ energy change at each step ≤ 10
- 0 ≤ cost at each step ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ initial energy E ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ elevator indices < stairs.length
- Maximum 1 elevator use per path
- Must maintain positive energy throughout path
