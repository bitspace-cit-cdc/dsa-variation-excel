### Car Fleets

You are given `n` cars traveling to the same destination on a one-lane highway. The cars' information is provided in two arrays:

- `position[i]`: The position of the `i-th` car (in miles).
- `speed[i]`: The speed of the `i-th` car (in miles per hour).

The destination is located at position `target` miles.
### Rules:
1. **Movement**:
    - A car cannot pass another car ahead of it. If it catches up to a slower car or car fleet, it will move at the slower car's speed.
2. **Car Fleet**:
    
    - A car fleet is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and speed.
    - A single car is also considered a car fleet.
3. **Joining a Fleet**:
    
    - If a car catches up to a fleet just as the fleet reaches the destination, the car is considered part of that fleet.

### Task:

Write a function to return the number of **different car fleets** that will arrive at the destination.

### Examples:

**Example 1**  
**Input:**  
`target = 12`  
`position = [10, 8, 0, 5, 3]`  
`speed = [2, 4, 1, 1, 3]`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**

- Car at position `10` with speed `2` will reach the destination in `(12 - 10) / 2 = 1 hour`.
- Car at position `8` with speed `4` will reach the destination in `(12 - 8) / 4 = 1 hour`.
    - These two cars form a single fleet.
- Car at position `5` with speed `1` and car at position `3` with speed `3` will form another fleet.
- Car at position `0` with speed `1` is its own fleet.
- Total fleets: `3`.

**Example 2**  
**Input:**  
`target = 10`  
`position = [3]`  
`speed = [3]`

**Output:**  
`1`

**Explanation:**

- There is only one car, so it forms a single fleet.


**Example 3**  
**Input:**  
`target = 100`  
`position = [0, 2, 4]`  
`speed = [4, 2, 1]`

**Output:**  
`1`

**Explanation:**

- All cars will catch up and form a single fleet before reaching the destination.

### Constraints:

1. `n == position.length == speed.length`
2. `1 <= n <= 10^5`
3. `0 < target <= 10^6`
4. `0 <= position[i] < target`
5. `0 < speed[i] <= 10^6`

### Notes:

- Use a **sorting-based approach** to process cars from farthest to nearest efficiently.
- The time complexity should be O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n) due to sorting, with O(n)O(n) for the main processing loop.
### Solution

#### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int carFleets(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = position.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> cars;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cars.push_back({position[i], speed[i]});
        }

        // Sort cars by position in descending order
        sort(cars.rbegin(), cars.rend());
        
        int fleets = 0;
        double prevTime = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            double time = (double)(target - cars[i].first) / cars[i].second;
            if (time > prevTime) {
                fleets++;
                prevTime = time;
            }
        }
        return fleets;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n, target;
    cin >> n >> target;

    vector<int> position(n), speed(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> position[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> speed[i];
    }

    Solution solution;
    cout << solution.carFleets(target, position, speed) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Python Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def car_fleets(self, target, position, speed):
        n = len(position)
        cars = [(position[i], speed[i]) for i in range(n)]
        # Sort cars by position in descending order
        cars.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

        fleets = 0
        prev_time = -1

        for i in range(n):
            time = (target - cars[i][0]) / cars[i][1]
            if time > prev_time:
                fleets += 1
                prev_time = time

        return fleets


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for _ in range(int(input())):
	    n, target = map(int, input().split())
	    position = list(map(int, input().split()))
	    speed = list(map(int, input().split()))
	
	    solution = Solution()
	    print(solution.car_fleets(target, position, speed))
