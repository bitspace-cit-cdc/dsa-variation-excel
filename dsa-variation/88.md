### **Problem Statement**

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any **fresh orange** that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the **minimum number of minutes** that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If it is impossible to rot all fresh oranges, return `-1`.

After every **2 minutes**, any fresh orange adjacent to at least **2 rotten oranges** will also rot, regardless of its original adjacency.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [
  [2, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:**

- Minute 1: The orange at `(0, 1)` rots.
- Minute 2: The oranges at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 0)` rot.
- Minute 3: The orange at `(2, 1)` rots.
- Minute 4: The orange at `(2, 2)` rots.
- All oranges are rotten in 4 minutes.

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [
  [2, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
-1
```

**Explanation:**

- Some oranges at the bottom-left corner can never rot because they are not adjacent to any rotten orange.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
grid = [
  [0, 2]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
0
```

**Explanation:**

- There are no fresh oranges to rot, so the elapsed time is `0`.

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq m, n \leq 10^2$
2. `grid[i][j]` is one of `0`, `1`, or `2`.
3. The function should return `-1` if it is impossible to rot all fresh oranges.
4. **Twist Condition**: After every **2 minutes**, fresh oranges adjacent to at least **2 rotten oranges** will rot instantly, even if they are not immediately adjacent.
5. The time complexity of the solution should be **O(m Ã— n)**.
