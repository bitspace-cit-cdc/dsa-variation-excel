### Problem Statement:

You have intercepted an encrypted message that uses a special encoding system based on both numbers and special characters. The message can be decoded using the following rules:
- Numbers decode as: "1"->"A" through "26"->"Z"
- Special characters "*" and "#" modify the next number in these ways:
  - "*n" multiplies the number by 2 (e.g., "*13" decodes to "M" since 13*2=26)
  - "#n" subtracts 1 from the number (e.g., "#2" decodes to "A" since 2-1=1)
- If a number becomes invalid after modification (>26 or <1), that entire decoding path is invalid

Return the number of ways to decode the string. If no valid decoding exists, return 0.

### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "*12#3"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Way 1: "*1" -> "B" (1*2=2), "#3" -> "B" (3-1=2)
Way 2: "1", "#3" -> "AB" (1->A, 3-1=2->B)

Example 2:
Input: s = "1*23"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Way 1: "1", "*2" -> "AD" (1->A, 2*2=4->D)
Way 2: "1", "2", "3" -> "ABC"
Way 3: "12", "3" -> "LC"

Example 3:
Input: s = "*27"
Output: 0
Explanation: "*27" -> 27*2=54, which is invalid (>26)
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100
- s contains only digits and the characters '*' and '#'
- The answer will fit in a 32-bit integer
- Special characters '*' and '#' can only modify single digits
- Leading zeros are not allowed
