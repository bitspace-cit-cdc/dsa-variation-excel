# Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. Additionally, if any number in the array has exactly the same number of 1's in its binary representation as the missing number, return -1 instead.

### Input:
- An integer array `nums` containing n distinct numbers

### Output:
- The missing number if no number in the array has the same count of 1's in its binary representation
- -1 if any number in the array has the same count of 1's in its binary representation as the missing number

---

### Examples:
1)
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
n = 3, as the array contains 3 numbers in range [0,3]
Missing number is 2 (binary: 10)
Other numbers:
3 (binary: 11) - has 2 ones
0 (binary: 00) - has 0 ones
1 (binary: 01) - has 1 one
Since no number in the array has exactly 1 one (which is what 2 has), return 2
```

2)
```
Input: nums = [0,1,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation:
n = 4, as the array contains 4 numbers in range [0,4]
Missing number is 2 (binary: 10) which has 1 one
Number 1 (binary: 01) also has 1 one
Therefore, return -1
```

3)
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
Missing number is 8 (binary: 1000) which has 1 one
No other number in the array has exactly 1 one in its binary representation
```

### Constraints:
- n == nums.length
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ n
- All the numbers of nums are unique
- Return -1 if any number in the array has the same count of 1's in its binary representation as the missing number
