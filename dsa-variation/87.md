### **Problem Statement**

You are given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains:

- An integer value (`val`).
- A list of its neighbors (`List[Node]`).

Your task is to return a **deep copy (clone)** of the graph, but you must **exclude any nodes whose values are divisible by `k`**. Ensure that the cloned graph retains its structure and connections, excluding the neglected nodes.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
Graph:
Node 1: val = 1, neighbors = [2, 3]
Node 2: val = 2, neighbors = [1, 4]
Node 3: val = 3, neighbors = [1, 4]
Node 4: val = 4, neighbors = [2, 3]
k = 2
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Cloned Graph:
Node 1: val = 1, neighbors = [3]
Node 3: val = 3, neighbors = [1]
```

**Explanation:**

- Nodes with values divisible by `k = 2` (i.e., `2` and `4`) are excluded.
- The remaining graph contains nodes `1` and `3`, with their connections preserved.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
Graph:
Node 1: val = 1, neighbors = [2]
Node 2: val = 2, neighbors = [1]
k = 1
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Cloned Graph:
[]
```

**Explanation:**

- Since all nodes are divisible by `k = 1`, the cloned graph is empty.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
Graph:
Node 1: val = 1, neighbors = [2, 3]
Node 2: val = 2, neighbors = [1, 3]
Node 3: val = 3, neighbors = [1, 2]
k = 5
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Cloned Graph:
Node 1: val = 1, neighbors = [2, 3]
Node 2: val = 2, neighbors = [1, 3]
Node 3: val = 3, neighbors = [1, 2]
```

**Explanation:**

- No nodes are divisible by `k = 5`, so the cloned graph is identical to the original.

---

### **Constraints**

1. The number of nodes in the graph is in the range **[1, 100]**.
2. The value of each node (`val`) is a unique integer in the range **[0, 100]**.
3. The graph is connected and undirected.
4. The adjacency list does not contain duplicate entries for neighbors.
5. Nodes with values divisible by `k` are excluded from the cloned graph.
6. The function should run in **O(V + E)** time complexity, where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges.
7. The cloned graph must preserve the structure and connectivity of all valid nodes.
