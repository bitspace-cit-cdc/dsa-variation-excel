### **Problem Statement**

Alice is the guardian of a magical deck of cards, where each card has a unique power level written on it. The deck is represented by an integer array `hand`, where `hand[i]` is the power level of the i-th card.

Alice wants to distribute the cards among the **warriors of the realm**. Each group of warriors must receive exactly `groupSize` cards, and the cards in each group must have **consecutive power levels**. For example, a valid group would be `[1, 2, 3]` if `groupSize = 3`.

However, hereâ€™s the twist: **some cards are cursed** and cannot be grouped! The cursed cards are represented in a separate array `cursed`. If a card is cursed, it cannot be included in any group.

Determine if it is possible for Alice to rearrange the cards into valid groups of size `groupSize`, given the cursed constraints. Return `true` if it is possible, or `false` otherwise.

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq \text{hand.length} \leq 10^4$
2. $1 \leq \text{groupSize} \leq \text{hand.length}$
3. $1 \leq \text{hand[i]} \leq 10^9$
4. $0 \leq \text{cursed.length} \leq \text{hand.length}$
5. All elements in `cursed` are valid values in `hand`.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
hand = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
groupSize = 3
cursed = [6, 7]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
true
```

#### Explanation:

1. Remove the cursed cards `6` and `7` from the deck. The remaining cards are `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 8]`.
2. Rearrange into groups:
    - `[1, 2, 3]`
    - `[2, 3, 4]`
    - The remaining card `8` is unused.
3. All groups are of size 3 and consist of consecutive cards, so it is possible.

---

#### Input:

```plaintext
hand = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
groupSize = 2
cursed = [3, 4]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
false
```

#### Explanation:

1. Remove the cursed cards `3` and `4` from the deck. The remaining cards are `[1, 2, 5, 6]`.
2. It is not possible to form valid groups of size 2 with consecutive power levels.
3. Return `false`.

---

#### Input:

```plaintext
hand = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
groupSize = 3
cursed = []
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
true
```

#### Explanation:

1. No cursed cards, so the deck remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. Rearrange into groups:
    - `[1, 2, 3]`
    - `[4, 5, 6]`
3. All groups are valid.
