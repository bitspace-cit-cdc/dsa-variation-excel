### **Problem Statement**

You are an adventurer trying to cross a treacherous series of platforms represented by an integer array `nums`. Each platform has a specific jump power, where `nums[i]` represents the **maximum jump length** you can make from platform `i`.

Your goal is to determine if you can **safely reach the last platform** starting from the first platform. If you land on a platform with no jump power, you may be stranded forever!

But hereâ€™s the twist: **some platforms are cursed** and will reduce your jump power by half (rounded down) once you land on them. These cursed platforms are marked with their indices in a separate list `cursed`.

Return `true` if you can safely reach the last platform, or `false` if you are stranded along the way.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
cursed = [2, 3]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
false
```

#### Explanation:

1. Starting at platform 0, you can jump up to 3 platforms ahead.
2. You jump to platform 2, but it is **cursed**. Your jump power is reduced from `1` to `0`.
3. You are stranded at platform 2 because you cannot jump further.
4. Therefore, you cannot reach the last platform.

#### Input:

```plaintext
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
cursed = [1, 3]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
true
```

#### Explanation:

1. Starting at platform 0, you can jump up to 2 platforms ahead.
2. You jump to platform 1, but it is **cursed**. Your jump power is reduced from `3` to `1`.
3. From platform 1, you jump to platform 2.
4. From platform 2, you jump to platform 4 and safely reach the last platform.

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^4$
2. $0 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^5$
3. $0 \leq \text{cursed.length} \leq \text{nums.length}$
4. $\text{cursed[i] are valid indices of the `nums` array}.$
