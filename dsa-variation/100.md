### Problem Statement:
You are a hacker attempting to infiltrate a circular network of cryptocurrency wallets. Each wallet contains a certain amount of cryptocurrency and has a security level. The wallets are arranged in a circular blockchain, where the first and last wallets are connected. You have two types of hacking tools:
1. Basic Tool: Can hack wallets with security level ≤ 5, takes 1 hour
2. Advanced Tool: Can hack any security level, takes 3 hours but reduces adjacent wallet security levels by 2

The system will detect your intrusion if you hack two adjacent wallets within a 4-hour window. Return the maximum cryptocurrency value you can obtain within 12 hours without being detected.

### Input and Output:
- Input: Array `wallets` where `wallets[i] = [crypto, security]`
  - `crypto`: Amount of cryptocurrency in the wallet
  - `security`: Security level (1-10)
- Output: Maximum cryptocurrency value obtainable and the sequence of wallets hacked

### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: wallets = [
    [100, 3],  
    [500, 8],
    [200, 4],
    [300, 7],
    [400, 5]
]
Output: [700, [1, 3, 5]]
Explanation: 
Hour 0: Hack wallet 1 (Basic Tool): 100 crypto
Hour 4: Hack wallet 3 (Advanced Tool): +300 crypto
Hour 8: Hack wallet 5 (Basic Tool): +400 crypto
Total: 800 crypto

Example 2:
Input: wallets = [
    [1000, 9],
    [2000, 8],
    [3000, 7],
    [1500, 6]
]
Output: [3500, [1, 3]]
Explanation: 
Hour 0: Hack wallet 1 (Advanced Tool): 1000 crypto
Adjacent wallets security reduced by 2
Hour 4: Hack wallet 3 (Advanced Tool): +2500 crypto
```

### Constraints:
- 3 ≤ wallets.length ≤ 100
- 100 ≤ crypto amount ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ security level ≤ 10
- Must complete all operations within 12 hours
- Cannot hack adjacent wallets within 4 hours
- First and last wallets are considered adjacent
- Security level reduction from Advanced Tool is permanent
