### **Problem Statement**

You are given an array of intervals `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents the start and end of the i-th interval, and an integer `k`.

Your task is to **merge intervals** if the overlap between two intervals is greater than or equal to `k`. An overlap between two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is defined as:

Overlap=max⁡(0,min⁡(b,d)−max⁡(a,c))\text{Overlap} = \max(0, \min(b, d) - \max(a, c))

After merging, return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### **Examples**

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
k = 1
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

**Explanation**:

1. The overlap between `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` is `min(3, 6) - max(1, 2) = 1`, which is greater than or equal to `k = 1`. Merge them into `[1, 6]`.
2. No overlap between `[1, 6]` and `[8, 10]`, or `[8, 10]` and `[15, 18]`. No further merging is needed.
3. Final result: `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`.

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 4], [4, 5], [10, 15], [12, 20]]
k = 0
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
[[1, 5], [10, 20]]
```

**Explanation**:

1. Overlap between `[1, 4]` and `[4, 5]` is `min(4, 5) - max(1, 4) = 0`, which is equal to `k = 0`. Merge them into `[1, 5]`.
2. Overlap between `[10, 15]` and `[12, 20]` is `min(15, 20) - max(10, 12) = 3`, which is greater than `k = 0`. Merge them into `[10, 20]`.
3. Final result: `[[1, 5], [10, 20]]`.

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[5, 10], [12, 16], [20, 25]]
k = 3
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
[[5, 10], [12, 16], [20, 25]]
```

**Explanation**:

1. Overlap between any two intervals is less than `k = 3`. No merging is needed.
2. Final result: `[[5, 10], [12, 16], [20, 25]]`.

### **Constraints**

1. 1 ≤ `intervals.length` ≤ 10⁴
2. -10⁵ ≤ `starti`, `endi` ≤ 10⁵
3. 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 10⁵
4. `starti ≤ endi` for all intervals in the input.
