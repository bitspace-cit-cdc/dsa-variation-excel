### **Problem Statement**

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. The network consists of **directed edges** represented as `times`, where `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`:

- `ui` is the source node,
- `vi` is the target node, and
- `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from `ui` to `vi`.

A signal is sent from a given node `k`. However, **twist**: some nodes in the network have a **processing delay** represented by an array `processingDelay`, where `processingDelay[j]` is the time a node `j` takes to process the signal before sending it to its neighbors.

Your task is to calculate the **minimum time** it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is **impossible** for all nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
n = 4
times = [[2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 1], [3, 4, 1]]
k = 2
processingDelay = [0, 0, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `2` sends the signal to node `1` and node `3`:
    - Signal reaches node `1` in `1` unit of time.
    - Signal reaches node `3` in `1` unit of time.
- Node `3` processes the signal (2-unit delay) and forwards it to node `4`:
    - Signal reaches node `4` in `1 (travel) + 2 (processing) = 3` units of time.
- Total time for all nodes to receive the signal is `4`.

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
n = 3
times = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2], [1, 3, 4]]
k = 1
processingDelay = [0, 0, 1]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `1` sends the signal to node `2` in `1` unit of time.
- Node `2` processes the signal (0 delay) and sends it to node `3`:
    - Signal reaches node `3` in `2` units of time (travel).
- Total time for all nodes to receive the signal is `3`.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
n = 3
times = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2]]
k = 1
processingDelay = [0, 0, 0]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
-1
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `1` sends the signal to node `2`, which sends it to node `3`.
- However, node `3` cannot send the signal back to node `1` due to a **directed edge** restriction, leaving some nodes unreachable.
- Return `-1` as it is impossible to reach all nodes.

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq n \leq 100$
2. $1 \leq times.length \leq 6000$
3. $times[i].length == 3$
4. $1 \leq ui, vi \leq n$, $ui \neq vi$
5. $0 \leq wi \leq 100$
6. $0 \leq processingDelay[j] \leq 100$
7. All nodes are guaranteed to have at least one outgoing or incoming edge.
