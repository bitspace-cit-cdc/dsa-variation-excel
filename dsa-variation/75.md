### **Problem Statement**

You are given an array of intervals `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents the start and end of the i-th interval. Your task is to return the **minimum number of intervals** that need to be removed to make the rest of the intervals **non-overlapping**, with the condition that **at most one overlap is allowed** between consecutive intervals.

### **Examples**

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
1
```

**Explanation**:

1. The intervals `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.
2. The intervals `[1, 3]` and `[3, 4]` overlap by more than one interval.
3. Remove `[1, 3]` to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
4. Final intervals: `[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`.

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5]]
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
1
```

**Explanation**:

1. The intervals `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 4]` overlap by more than one interval.
2. Remove `[1, 3]` to allow at most one overlap between `[1, 2]` and `[2, 4]`.
3. Final intervals: `[[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5]]`.

---

**Input**:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7]]
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation**:

1. All intervals overlap by more than one interval.
2. Remove `[2, 6]` and `[3, 7]` to leave only `[1, 5]` as a non-overlapping interval.

### **Constraints**

1. 1 ≤ `intervals.length` ≤ 10⁴
2. -10⁵ ≤ `starti`, `endi` ≤ 10⁵
3. `starti ≤ endi` for all intervals in the input.
