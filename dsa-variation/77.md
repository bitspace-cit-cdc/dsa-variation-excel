### **Problem Statement**

You are given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals`, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]` and start<endstart < end.

Your task is to determine the **maximum number of times a room is used** if the schedule is managed optimally.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [4, 6], [7, 8]]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
4
```

#### Explanation:

1. If the room is managed optimally, the schedule can be as follows:
    - Meeting `[1, 3]` starts and ends in the room.
    - Meeting `[2, 5]` uses the room optimally right after meeting `[1, 3]` ends.
    - Meeting `[4, 6]` uses the room next.
    - Meeting `[7, 8]` uses the room at the end.
2. Therefore, the room is used 4 times in total.

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6], [7, 8]]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
3
```

#### Explanation:

1. Optimally scheduling the room:
    - Meeting `[1, 4]` uses the room first.
    - Meeting `[4, 6]` uses the room immediately after.
    - Meeting `[7, 8]` uses the room next.
2. Meeting `[2, 5]` overlaps entirely with other meetings, so it cannot use the room without another overlap.
3. The room is used 3 times in total.

#### Input:

```plaintext
intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
4
```

#### Explanation:

1. Each meeting can use the room optimally in sequence:
    - Meeting `[1, 2]`
    - Meeting `[2, 3]`
    - Meeting `[3, 4]`
    - Meeting `[4, 5]`
2. The room is used 4 times in total.

### **Constraints**

1. 1 ≤ `intervals.length` ≤ 10⁴
2. 0 ≤ `start`, `end` ≤ 10⁵
3. start<endstart < end for all intervals.
