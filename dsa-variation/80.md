### **Problem Statement**

Continuing your adventure across the platforms, not only do you need to **reach the last platform**, but you must now **minimize the number of jumps** required to do so.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`. Each element `nums[i]` represents the **maximum length of a forward jump** you can make from platform `i`. Starting from platform `nums[0]`, your goal is to reach the final platform `nums[n - 1]` using the **fewest jumps possible**.

The platforms marked as **cursed** (from Part 1) still reduce your jump power by half (rounded down) if you land on them, adding another layer of difficulty.

Return the **minimum number of jumps** needed to reach the last platform.

### **Examples**

#### Input:

```plaintext
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
cursed = [2]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
2
```

#### Explanation:

1. Start at platform 0, where `nums[0] = 2`. Jump to platform 1.
2. Platform 1 has `nums[1] = 3`. Jump to platform 4, the last platform.
3. Only **2 jumps** are required.

#### Input:

```plaintext
nums = [3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5]
cursed = [3, 4]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
3
```

#### Explanation:

1. Start at platform 0, where `nums[0] = 3`. Jump to platform 1.
2. Platform 1 has `nums[1] = 4`. Jump to platform 4, but it is **cursed**, reducing the jump power to `nums[4] = 1`.
3. From platform 4, jump to platform 5.
4. From platform 5, jump to platform 6, the last platform.
5. A total of **3 jumps** are required.

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^4$
2. $0 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^5$
3. $0 \leq \text{cursed.length} \leq \text{nums.length}$
4. $cursed[i]$ are valid indices of the `nums` array.
5. The test cases are generated such that you can always reach the last platform.
