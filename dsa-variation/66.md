### **Problem Statement**

You are part of a university admissions office and need to dynamically determine the **kth highest test score** from a stream of incoming applicant scores. This helps adjust cut-off marks for interviews and admissions in real-time.

Your task is to implement a class `KthLargest` that supports the following functionality:

1. **Initialization**: The class is initialized with an integer `k` and a list of test scores `nums`. The objective is to maintain the kth largest score in the stream of scores.
2. **Add Score**: The `add` method allows adding a new score to the stream and returns the **kth largest score** after adding the new value.
3. **Reset Window**: The `reset_window` method allows the admissions office to reset the system to consider only the last `w` scores in the stream.

### **Class Definition**

```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        pass

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        pass

    def reset_window(self, w: int) -> None:
        pass
```

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq k \leq 10^4$ - The value of `k` is guaranteed to be within this range.
2. $0 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5$ - The initial stream of test scores may be empty.
3. $-10^4 \leq \text{nums[i]}, \text{val} \leq 10^4$- Scores can be negative or positive integers.
4. The `add` method will be called up to $10^5$ times.
5. The `reset_window` method will be called occasionally, but it must reset the list to include only the last ww scores efficiently.

### **Sample Input and Output**

#### Input:

```plaintext
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add", "reset_window", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4], [3], [6], [7]]
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8, null, 5, 6]
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Initialize** `KthLargest` with `k = 3` and scores `[4, 5, 8, 2]`: The 3rd largest score is `4`.
2. **Add** `3`: Scores become `[4, 5, 8, 2, 3]`. The 3rd largest score is `4`.
3. **Add** `5`: Scores become `[4, 5, 8, 2, 3, 5]`. The 3rd largest score is `5`.
4. **Add** `10`: Scores become `[4, 5, 8, 2, 3, 5, 10]`. The 3rd largest score is `5`.
5. **Add** `9`: Scores become `[4, 5, 8, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9]`. The 3rd largest score is `8`.
6. **Add** `4`: Scores become `[4, 5, 8, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 4]`. The 3rd largest score is `8`.
7. **Reset Window** to last `3` scores: Scores become `[4, 4, 9]`.
8. **Add** `6`: Scores become `[4, 4, 9, 6]`. The 3rd largest score is `5`.
9. **Add** `7`: Scores become `[4, 4, 9, 6, 7]`. The 3rd largest score is `6

### Solution
#### Python Implementation
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapify
from typing import List

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = nums[:]
        heapify(self.min_heap)  # Convert nums into a min-heap
        # Ensure the heap only contains the top k elements
        while len(self.min_heap) > k:
            heappop(self.min_heap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        # Add the new value to the heap
        heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        # If the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest element
        if len(self.min_heap) > self.k:
            heappop(self.min_heap)
        # Return the kth largest element (smallest in the heap)
        return self.min_heap[0]

    def reset_window(self, w: int) -> None:
        # Keep only the last w scores by trimming the list
        while len(self.min_heap) > w:
            heappop(self.min_heap)
        self.k = min(self.k, w)  # Adjust k if the window size is smaller

# Main function for testing
def main():
    commands = input().split(",")  # List of commands
    data = eval(input())  # Corresponding inputs for the commands
    obj = None
    results = []

    for command, args in zip(commands, data):
        if command == "KthLargest":
            obj = KthLargest(args[0], args[1])
            results.append(None)
        elif command == "add":
            results.append(obj.add(args[0]))
        elif command == "reset_window":
            obj.reset_window(args[0])
            results.append(None)
    
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
