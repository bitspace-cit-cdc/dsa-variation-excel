## Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. Each coin has a usage limit `k` - you cannot use any coin denomination more than `k` times. Additionally, you must use at least 2 different coin denominations if the amount is greater than the maximum coin value.
Return *the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins following the conditions, return `-1`.

---
### Input:
- Integer array `coins` where `coins[i]` represents the denomination of the i-th coin
- Integer `amount` representing the target sum
- Integer `k` representing the maximum times you can use any single coin denomination

---
### Output:
- Integer representing the minimum number of coins needed
- Return -1 if it's impossible to make the amount

---

Example 1:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11, k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal combination is: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 (using 3 coins)
Note that we can't use six 2's due to the usage limit k = 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: coins = [2,3], amount = 4, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need to use at least 2 different denominations for amounts greater than max(coins) = 3, but it's impossible with these coins
```

Example 3:
```
Input: coins = [1,3,4], amount = 6, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6 is valid since we use denomination 3 only twice
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ coins.length ≤ 12
- 1 ≤ coins\[i\] ≤ 2³¹ - 1
- 0 ≤ amount ≤ 10⁴
- All values in coins are unique
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁴
- coins are sorted in ascending order
- Must use at least 2 different denominations if amount > max(coins)
- Each coin denomination can be used at most k times
