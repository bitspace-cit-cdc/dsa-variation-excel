### **Problem Statement**

You are an explorer studying a mysterious island surrounded by two oceans: the **Pacific Ocean** (touching the island's left and top edges) and the **Atlantic Ocean** (touching the island's right and bottom edges). The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells, and each cell has a height above sea level.

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights`, where `heights[r][c]` represents the height of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`. Rainwater can flow from a cell to its neighboring cells **north, south, east, or west** if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water that reaches the edges of the island flows into the respective ocean.

Some cells are blocked by obstacles (represented by `-1` in the `heights` matrix), and water cannot flow through these cells.

Your task is to determine all the cells `(r, c)` from which **rainwater can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans**. Return the result as a **2D list** of coordinates `result`, where `result[i] = [ri, ci]`.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
heights = [
  [1, 2, 2, 3, 5],
  [3, 2, 3, 4, 4],
  [2, 4, 5, 3, 1],
  [6, 7, 1, 4, 5],
  [5, 1, 1, 2, 4]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[
  [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [3, 0],
  [3, 1], [4, 0]
]
```

**Explanation:**

- Rainwater from cells like `(0, 4)` can flow to both oceans.
- Cells `(3, 0)` and `(3, 1)` drain into both oceans due to their high elevations.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
heights = [
  [2, 1, 1],
  [1, -1, 1],
  [1, 1, 2]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[
  [0, 0], [0, 2], [2, 0], [2, 2]
]
```

**Explanation:**

- Cells with height `-1` are obstacles and block water flow.
- Rainwater can flow to both oceans from cells like `(0, 0)` and `(2, 2)`.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
heights = [
  [1]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[
  [0, 0]
]
```

**Explanation:**

- The single cell flows to both oceans.

---

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq m, n \leq 200$
2. $0 \leq heights[r][c] \leq 10^6$ or `heights[r][c] = -1` (obstacle).
3. Rainwater flows only to cells with height **less than or equal to** the current cell.
4. Cells marked as `-1` represent obstacles and cannot be used for water flow.
5. The result must include all unique cells that allow water to flow to **both oceans**.
