## Problem Statement:
Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2` with the following rules:
An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

* `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
* `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
* `|n - m| <= 1`
* Each substring must be of length at least `k`
* The **interleaving** must alternate between vowels and consonants
* If a substring from `s` starts with a vowel, the next substring from `t` must start with a consonant, and vice versa
* The **interleaving** starts with a substring that has more vowels than consonants
## Input:
- String `s1`
- String `s2`
- String `s3`
- Integer `k` representing minimum substring length

## Output:
- Boolean indicating if valid interleaving exists

---
## Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: 
s1 splits into ["aa", "bcc"]
s2 splits into ["dbb", "ca"]
Interleaving: "aa" + "dbb" + "bcc" + "ca"
- Each substring length ≥ 2
- Alternates between vowel-start ("aa") and consonant-start ("dbb")
- First substring "aa" has more vowels than consonants
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc", k = 1
Output: false
Explanation: No valid interleaving exists that satisfies vowel/consonant alternation
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", s3 = "abcdef", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Cannot create valid interleaving with minimum substring length 2
```

### Constraints:
- 0 ≤ s1.length, s2.length ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ s3.length ≤ 200
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10
- s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters
- Each substring must have length ≥ k
- Must alternate between vowel-start and consonant-start substrings
- First substring must have more vowels than consonants
- s3.length == s1.length + s2.length
- The interleaving must use all characters from s1 and s2
