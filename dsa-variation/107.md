## Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing** subsequence* that satisfies these conditions:
1. The difference between any two consecutive elements in the subsequence must be exactly `k`
2. The subsequence must contain at least one even and one odd number
3. If multiple such subsequences exist, return the length of the one with the smallest sum
---
### Input:
- Integer array `nums`
- Integer `k` representing the required difference between consecutive elements
### Output:
- Integer representing the length of the longest valid subsequence

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,12,14,17,20], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subsequence [3,6,9,12] is:
- Strictly increasing
- Has difference of 3 between consecutive elements
- Contains odd (3,9) and even (6,12) numbers
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: No subsequence exists where consecutive elements differ by exactly 2
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The subsequence [2,4,6] is valid:
- Strictly increasing
- Has difference of 2 between consecutive elements
- Contains even numbers (2,4,6)
However, [1,3,5,7] though longer is not valid as it doesn't contain any even number
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 2500
- -10⁴ ≤ nums\[i\] ≤ 10⁴
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁴
- The subsequence must be strictly increasing
- Consecutive elements in the subsequence must differ by exactly k
- The subsequence must contain at least one even and one odd number
- If multiple valid subsequences of same length exist, consider the one with minimum sum
