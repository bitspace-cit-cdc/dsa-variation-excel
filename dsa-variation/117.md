### Problem Statement:

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for these special characters:
* `'.'` Matches any single character except digits
* `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element
* `'#'` Matches exactly one digit (0-9)
* `'^'` Matches the start of a word (letter preceded by non-letter or string start)
* `'$'` Matches the end of a word (letter followed by non-letter or string end)

Additional rules:
1. The total number of special characters used in the match must be less than `k`
2. If '*' follows '#', it can only match up to 3 consecutive digits
3. Pattern cannot have two special characters consecutively (except when one is '*')
4. The matching must cover the **entire** input string (not partial)

### Input:
- String s (input string)
- String p (pattern)
- Integer k (maximum special characters allowed)

### Output:
- Boolean indicating if pattern matches string under given constraints

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc123def", p = "^abc#*def$", k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: 
- '^' matches 'abc' as start of word
- '#*' matches '123' (three digits)
- '$' matches 'def' as end of word
- Uses 3 special chars (^, #, $) < k
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "test.123", p = "....#*", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Pattern would match but uses 5 special chars (4 dots + #) ≥ k
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a1b2", p = "#.#.", k = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
- First '#' matches '1'
- '.' matches 'b'
- Second '#' matches '2'
- Last '.' invalid as it matches nothing
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ p.length ≤ 30
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10
- s contains only lowercase English letters and digits
- p contains only lowercase English letters and special characters ('.','^','$','#','*')
- Pattern cannot have two special characters consecutively (except when one is '*')
- Must use less than k special characters in the match
- '#*' can match at most 3 consecutive digits
- '.' cannot match digits
- The entire string must be matched
