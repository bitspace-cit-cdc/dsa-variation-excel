## Problem Statement:
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`. Additionally, if at any point during your calculation, any intermediate result contains more than three consecutive 1's in its binary representation, return 0.

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`

### Output:
- The sum of `a` and `b` if no intermediate result has more than three consecutive 1's in binary
- 0 if any intermediate result has more than three consecutive 1's in binary

### Examples:
1)
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1 (01) and 2 (10) when added give 3 (11)
No intermediate result has more than three consecutive 1's
```

2)
```
Input: a = 7, b = 8
Output: 0
Explanation:
7 (0111) and 8 (1000) 
During calculation, an intermediate result would contain 1111, which has four consecutive 1's
Therefore, return 0
```

3)
```
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
2 (10) and 3 (11) when added give 5 (101)
No intermediate result has more than three consecutive 1's
```

### Constraints:
- -1000 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000
- You cannot use operators + and -
- Any intermediate result in your calculation must not contain more than three consecutive 1's in its binary representation
- The solution should maintain the same time complexity as the original problem
- You must check every intermediate step of your calculation for the consecutive 1's constraint
