### **Problem Statement**

Design a **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) System** that supports the following operations:

1. **Subscribe**: Subscribe a user to receive updates from a specific publisher.
2. **Unsubscribe**: Remove a user's subscription to a specific publisher.
3. **Publish**: Publish a new message from a publisher, which will be received by all their subscribers.
4. **Query**: Retrieve the most recent message published by a specific publisher.

---
### **Function Definitions**

Implement the following functions:

1. `subscribe(subscriber: str, publisher: str)`: Subscribes `subscriber` to `publisher`'s updates.
2. `unsubscribe(subscriber: str, publisher: str)`: Removes `subscriber`'s subscription to `publisher`.
3. `publish(publisher: str, message: str)`: Publishes a message from `publisher`, notifying all their subscribers.
4. `query(publisher: str) -> str`: Returns the most recent message published by `publisher`.

---
### **Examples**

**Input**:

```plaintext
["subscribe", "subscribe", "publish", "query", "unsubscribe", "publish", "query"]
[["Alice", "User1"], ["Bob", "User1"], ["User1", "Hello, World!"], ["User1"], ["Alice", "User1"], ["User1", "New Update"], ["User1"]]
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
[null, null, null, "Hello, World!", null, null, "New Update"]
```

---

**Explanation**:

1. `subscribe("Alice", "User1")`: Alice subscribes to User1's updates.
2. `subscribe("Bob", "User1")`: Bob subscribes to User1's updates.
3. `publish("User1", "Hello, World!")`: User1 publishes the message "Hello, World!". Both Alice and Bob receive it.
4. `query("User1")`: Returns the most recent message published by User1, which is "Hello, World!".
5. `unsubscribe("Alice", "User1")`: Alice unsubscribes from User1's updates.
6. `publish("User1", "New Update")`: User1 publishes "New Update". Only Bob receives this update.
7. `query("User1")`: Returns the most recent message published by User1, which is "New Update".

---

### **Constraints**

1. `subscriber` and `publisher` are unique strings representing users.
2. There will be at most **10‚Å¥ operations** across all function calls.
3. Each user can subscribe to multiple publishers, and each publisher can have multiple subscribers.
