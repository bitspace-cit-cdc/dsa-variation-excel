### Problem Statement:
Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. Additionally, at each turn in the spiral path (when changing direction), if the sum of the next three elements in the new direction is odd, reverse the direction and continue the spiral in the opposite way for that side.

---
## Input:
- An m x n matrix of integers

## Output:
- An array of integers representing elements in spiral order with direction changes based on the three-element sum constraint

## Examples:
1)
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],
                 [4,5,6],
                 [7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
Explanation: 
At first turn (3->6->9): sum = 18 (even), continue clockwise
At second turn (9->8->7): sum = 24 (even), continue clockwise
Last element (5) is included naturally
```

2)
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],
                 [5,6,7,8],
                 [9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
Explanation:
At first turn (4->8->12): sum = 24 (even), continue clockwise
At second turn (12->11->10): sum = 33 (odd), reverse direction
Next turn (5->6->7): sum = 18 (even), continue in current direction
```

3)
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2],
                 [3,4]]
Output: [1,2,4,3]
Explanation:
Only one turn (2->4->3): sum = 9 (odd), but no more elements in reverse direction
```

---
## Constraints:
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 10
- -100 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 100
- Direction must reverse when sum of next three elements in new direction is odd
- If less than three elements remain in new direction, continue with original direction
- Each element must be visited exactly once
