### Problem Statement:
Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find all elements that appear exactly once subject to these conditions:
1. Every element appears either k times or exactly once
2. The elements that appear once must have a sum that is prime
3. The elements that appear once must include at least one even and one odd number
4. All single elements must be within a range of `maxElement/2` from each other

You must implement a solution with linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Input:
- Integer array `nums`
- Integer `k` representing frequency of repeated elements

### Output:
- Integer array containing all elements that appear exactly once
- Return empty array if conditions are not met

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,3,7,1,1,1,5], k = 3
Output: [3,5,7]
Explanation: 
- 2 and 1 appear k=3 times
- 3,5,7 appear once
- Sum(3,5,7) = 15 is prime
- Contains odd (3,5,7) and even numbers
- All within range of max(7)/2 from each other
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4], k = 2
Output: []
Explanation: Element 4 appears once but no other single elements exist
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,8,5,5,5,11], k = 3
Output: []
Explanation: 8,11 appear once but difference (11-8 = 3) > 8/2
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 3 * 10⁴
- -3 * 10⁴ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 3 * 10⁴
- 2 ≤ k ≤ 10
- Each element appears either k times or once
- Sum of single elements must be prime
- Single elements must include at least one even and odd number
- Range of single elements must be ≤ maxElement/2
- Must use linear time complexity
- Must use constant extra space
