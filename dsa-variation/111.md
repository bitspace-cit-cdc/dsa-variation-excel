# Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`. You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'`, `'-'`, or `'*'` before each integer in nums and optionally grouping any two consecutive numbers with parentheses `()`.
* For example, if `nums = [2, 1, 3]`, one possible expression is `"+2*(1-3)"` which evaluates to -4
* You cannot use multiple operators between same numbers (like "2*+1")
* Parentheses can only group exactly two numbers and their operator
* Operations are performed left to right unless modified by parentheses

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

###  Input:
- Integer array `nums`
- Integer `target` representing desired result

### Output:
- Integer representing number of valid expressions evaluating to target

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3], target = -4
Output: 2
Explanation: Valid expressions:
1. "+2*(1-3)" = -4
2. "+(2*1-3)" = -1 (invalid as doesn't equal target)
3. "+2*1-3" = -1 (invalid as doesn't equal target)
4. "+2*(1-3)" = -4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Valid expressions:
1. "+1+2" = 3
2. "+(1+2)" = 3
Note: "+1*2" would be invalid as multiplication isn't needed for target
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,2,2], target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: Only valid expression is "+5*2+2" = 12
"+(5*2)+2" is considered same as "+5*2+2" as parentheses don't change result
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 15
- -20 ≤ nums\[i\] ≤ 20
- -10⁸ ≤ target ≤ 10⁸
- Valid operators are '+', '-', and '*'
- Parentheses can only group two consecutive numbers and their operator
- Expressions are evaluated left to right unless modified by parentheses
- Each number must be preceded by exactly one operator
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer
- Expressions that evaluate to same value with different parentheses placements count as one expression
