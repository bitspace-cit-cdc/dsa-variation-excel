### **Problem Statement**

You are a student enrolled in a series of `numCourses` subjects, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. Some courses have prerequisites, represented as an array `prerequisites`, where:

- `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must complete course `bi` **before** taking course `ai`.

Your task is to determine a valid order of courses you can take to complete all the subjects. If there are multiple valid orders, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all the courses, return an empty array.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
numCourses = 4
prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```

**Explanation:**

- To take course `1`, you must complete course `0`.
- To take course `2`, you must complete course `1`.
- To take course `3`, you must complete course `2`.
- Therefore, the valid order is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
numCourses = 2
prerequisites = [[1, 0]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[0, 1]
```

**Explanation:**

- To take course `1`, you must complete course `0`.
- The valid order is `[0, 1]`.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
numCourses = 3
prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [0, 2]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[]
```

**Explanation:**

- There is a cycle in the prerequisites: course `0` depends on `2`, which depends on `1`, which depends on `0`.
- Therefore, it is impossible to finish all courses.

### **Constraints**

1. $1 \leq numCourses \leq 2000$
2. $0 \leq prerequisites.length \leq 5000$
3. `prerequisites[i].length = 2`
4. $0 \leq ai, bi < numCourses$
5. All the prerequisites are unique.
6. The input guarantees no duplicate prerequisite pairs.
