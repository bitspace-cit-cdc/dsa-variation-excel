### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets that satisfy all these conditions:
1. The absolute difference between sums of the two subsets must be exactly `k`
2. Each subset must contain at least one prime number
3. The size of the larger subset can't exceed twice the size of the smaller subset
Return `false` if no such partition exists.

## Input:
- Integer array `nums`
- Integer `k` representing required difference between subset sums

## Output:
- Boolean indicating whether valid partition exists

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5,2,7], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Partition into [1,5,11] and [5,2,7]
- First subset sum = 17, Second subset sum = 15, difference = 2
- 11 is prime in first subset, 2,7 are prime in second subset
- Larger subset has size 3, smaller has size 3 (valid ratio)
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: false
Explanation: No valid partition exists because:
While [1,4] and [2,3] have equal sums, 4 is not prime
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,8,13,7], k = 1
Output: false
Explanation: Any partition with difference 1 would require one subset to have size > 2x other subset
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 200
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10⁴
- The absolute difference between subset sums must be exactly k
- Each subset must contain at least one prime number
- Size of larger subset cannot exceed 2 * size of smaller subset
- Each number must be used exactly once
- Each number must be in exactly one subset
