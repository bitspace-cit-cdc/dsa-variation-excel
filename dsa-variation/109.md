### Problem Statement:

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot has a battery level `b` and the following movement rules:
1. Moving right costs 2 battery units
2. Moving down costs 1 battery unit
3. The robot can "leap" by moving 2 cells right at once, costing 3 battery units
4. The robot must maintain battery level above 0 throughout the journey
5. The robot must end with at least `k` battery units remaining

Given integers `m`, `n`, `b` (initial battery), and `k` (required ending battery), return *the number of possible unique paths*.

---
### Input:
- Integers `m` and `n` representing grid dimensions
- Integer `b` representing initial battery level
- Integer `k` representing required ending battery level

### Output:
- Integer representing number of unique valid paths

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, b = 6, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid paths:
1. Right→Right→Down→Down (costs 5 battery units)
2. Right→Down→Right→Down (costs 5 battery units)
3. Down→Right→Right→Down (costs 5 battery units)
Leaping is not used as it would consume too much battery
```

Example 2:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 4, b = 8, k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Can use regular moves and one leap move
The path Leap→Down→Right has cost 6, ending with required 2 units
```

Example 3:
```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, b = 3, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No valid path exists that maintains required battery levels
```

---
### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ b ≤ 200
- 0 ≤ k ≤ b
- Right movement costs 2 battery units
- Down movement costs 1 battery unit
- Leap movement costs 3 battery units
- Battery must stay positive throughout path
- Must end with at least k battery units
- The answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10⁹
