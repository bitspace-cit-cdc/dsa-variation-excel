### Problem Statement:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy while following an additional constraint. A happy number is defined by the following process:
* Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
* Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
* Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
* Additionally, during each iteration, if the sum of squares contains any digit more than twice, restart the process with the original number n + 1.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number according to these rules, and `false` if not.

### Input:
- A positive integer n

### Output:
- Boolean indicating if n is a happy number under the new constraints

### Examples:
1)
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
No digit appears more than twice in any sum, and process ends in 1
```

2)
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation:
2² = 4
4² = 16
1² + 6² = 37
3² + 7² = 58
5² + 8² = 89
8² + 9² = 145
1² + 4² + 5² = 42
4² + 2² = 20
2² + 0² = 4
Forms a cycle without reaching 1
```

3)
```
Input: n = 44
Output: true
Explanation:
4² + 4² = 32 (contains two 4s, so restart with 45)
4² + 5² = 41
4² + 1² = 17
1² + 7² = 50
5² + 0² = 25
2² + 5² = 29
2² + 9² = 85
8² + 5² = 89
8² + 9² = 145
1² + 4² + 5² = 42
4² + 2² = 20
2² + 0² = 4
4² = 16
1² + 6² = 37
3² + 7² = 58
5² + 8² = 89
Continues in a cycle, returns false
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2³¹ - 1
- If any sum of squares contains a digit more than twice, restart with n + 1
- Must detect cycles to avoid infinite loops
- The process should handle the restart condition without exceeding the integer limit
- Solution should maintain the same space complexity as the original problem
