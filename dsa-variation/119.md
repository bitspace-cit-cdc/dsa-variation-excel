### Problem Statement:

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns `true` if its binary representation satisfies all these conditions:
1. The number of set bits (1s) must be prime
2. All set bits must be at least `k` positions apart
3. The binary representation must start and end with same bit (0 or 1)
4. The longest sequence of consecutive zeros must be even length
5. No two adjacent 1s can have exactly one 0 between them

### Input:
- Integer n (the number to analyze)
- Integer k (minimum distance between set bits)

### Output:
- Boolean indicating if all conditions are met

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 149, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Binary = 10010101
- Has 4 set bits (prime)
- All 1s are at least 2 positions apart
- Starts and ends with 1
- Longest zero sequence is 2 (even)
- No two 1s have exactly one 0 between them
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 10, k = 1
Output: false
Explanation: Binary = 1010
- Has 2 set bits (not prime)
- Other conditions are met but prime requirement fails
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 272, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Binary = 100010000
- Has 2 set bits
- Although bits are 3 positions apart
- Starts with 1 and ends with 0 (different)
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2³¹ - 1
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 16
- Number of set bits must be prime
- All set bits must be at least k positions apart
- First and last bits must be same
- Longest sequence of zeros must be even length
- No two 1s can have exactly one 0 between them
