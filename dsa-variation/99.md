### Problem Statement:
You are a security system tester evaluating a smart neighborhood's security setup. Each house has a security rating `rating` and a vulnerability score `vulnerability`. Houses also have different types of security systems that take different times to test. The goal is to test as many houses as possible in a given timeframe while maintaining a minimum success probability.
Rules:
- If you test a house with high vulnerability, adjacent houses' security ratings temporarily increase by 50% due to heightened awareness
- Houses with security ratings above 80 require specialized equipment that takes 2 time units to set up
- Each house can only be tested during its designated time window
- You must maintain an average success probability of at least 75% across all tested houses

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: Array of houses where `houses[i] = [rating, vulnerability, startTime, endTime]`
  - `rating`: Security system rating (0-100)
  - `vulnerability`: Vulnerability score (0-100)
  - `startTime`, `endTime`: Testing window in 24-hour format
- Output: Maximum number of houses that can be tested while meeting all constraints and the testing sequence

----
### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: houses = [
    [70, 30, 900, 1700],  // [rating, vulnerability, startTime, endTime]
    [85, 60, 1000, 1600],
    [60, 40, 1100, 1500],
    [90, 70, 1300, 1800]
]
Output: [3, [1, 3, 4]]
Explanation: 
- Test house 1 during 9:00-10:00
- Skip house 2 (adjacent effects would make others untestable)
- Test house 3 during 11:00-12:00
- Test house 4 during 13:00-15:00 (extra time for specialized equipment)

Example 2:
Input: houses = [
    [95, 80, 800, 1200],
    [60, 30, 900, 1300],
    [75, 50, 1000, 1400]
]
Output: [2, [2, 3]]
Explanation: First house requires specialized equipment and has high vulnerability,
making adjacent houses harder to test
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ houses.length ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ rating, vulnerability ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ startTime < endTime ≤ 2400
- Each test takes 1 time unit (or 2 for houses with rating > 80)
- Success probability = (100 - rating + vulnerability)/100
- Adjacent effects last for 2 time units
- Time windows are in 24-hour format
