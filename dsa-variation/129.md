# Problem Statement:
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `xn`). Additionally, during the calculation, if any intermediate result has more than 3 decimal places and the digits in decimal places form a strictly increasing sequence, truncate the result to 3 decimal places before continuing the calculation.

### Input:
- A double x representing the base
- An integer n representing the power

### Output:
- Double value representing x^n following the decimal place constraint
- If n < 0, return the reciprocal value (1/x^|n|)

### Examples:
1)
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Explanation: 
No intermediate result has more than 3 increasing decimal places
```

2)
```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.261
Explanation:
2.1 * 2.1 = 4.41 (no truncation needed)
4.41 * 2.1 = 9.2610 (decimal digits 2,6,1,0 are not increasing)
```

3)
```
Input: x = 1.23456, n = 2
Output: 1.524
Explanation:
1.23456 * 1.23456 = 1.52413... (decimal digits 5,2,4,1,3 are not increasing)
```

4)
```
Input: x = 3.12345, n = 2
Output: 9.756
Explanation:
3.12345 * 3.12345 = 9.75595... (decimal digits 7,5,5,9,5 are not increasing)
```

### Constraints:
- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- -2³¹ ≤ n ≤ 2³¹-1
- n is an integer
- -10⁴ ≤ x^n ≤ 10⁴
- Decimal places must be checked for strictly increasing sequence
- If decimal digits form increasing sequence, truncate to 3 places
- Solution should maintain similar time complexity to original problem
- Results should be accurate to at least 3 decimal places
