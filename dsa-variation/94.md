# Problem Statement:

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi, timei]` represent the departure airport, arrival airport, and flight duration (in hours) of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order that minimizes the total travel time while meeting the following conditions:
- Must begin from `"LAX"` and end at `"NYC"`
- Can only take flights during daylight hours (6 AM to 8 PM local time)
- Maximum 2 layovers allowed
- Minimum layover time is 1 hour and maximum is 4 hours

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: Array of tickets, where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi, timei, departurei]`
  - `fromi` and `toi` are three-letter airport codes
  - `timei` is flight duration in hours
  - `departurei` is the departure time in 24-hour format (e.g., 1430 for 2:30 PM)
- Output: Array representing the optimal itinerary that minimizes total travel time while meeting all constraints

---
### Examples:

```
Example 1:
Input: tickets = [
    ["LAX", "DFW", 3, 0800],
    ["DFW", "NYC", 3, 1300],
    ["LAX", "ORD", 4, 0700],
    ["ORD", "NYC", 2, 1400]
]
Output: ["LAX", "DFW", "NYC"]
Total Time: 7 hours (3 hours LAX->DFW, 1 hour layover, 3 hours DFW->NYC)

Example 2:
Input: tickets = [
    ["LAX", "SEA", 3, 0900],
    ["SEA", "ORD", 4, 1400],
    ["ORD", "NYC", 2, 1900]
]
Output: []
Explanation: No valid itinerary exists because ORD->NYC flight departs at 7 PM, arriving after 8 PM
```

## Constraints:
- 1 ≤ tickets.length ≤ 300
- `tickets[i].length == 4`
- All airport codes are three uppercase letters
- 600 ≤ departurei ≤ 2000 (6 AM to 8 PM)
- 1 ≤ timei ≤ 12
- The departure airport is always different from the arrival airport
- At least one valid path exists from LAX to NYC
