	### **Problem Statement**
	
	You are given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` that represents a map where:
	
	- `'1'` represents **land**,
	- `'0'` represents **water**.
	
	Your task is to determine the **number of islands** in the grid.
	
	An **island** is formed by a group of connected lands (`'1'`) that are connected **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally**. Islands are surrounded by water (`'0'`), and the grid's boundaries are considered water.
	
	Return the total number of islands in the grid.

	### **Examples**
	
	#### Input:
	
	```plaintext
	grid = [
	  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
	  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
	  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
	  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
	]
	```
	
	#### Output:
	
	```plaintext
	3
	```
	
	#### Explanation:
	
	1. There are three islands:
	    - One island in the top-left corner spanning two rows and two columns.
	    - One island in the middle of the grid.
	    - One island in the bottom-right corner spanning two cells.

	#### Input:
	
	```plaintext
	grid = [
	  [1, 0, 0],
	  [0, 1, 0],
	  [0, 0, 1]
	]
	```
	
	#### Output:
	
	```plaintext
	3
	```
	
	#### Explanation:
	
	1. Each land cell is isolated, forming three separate islands.

	#### Input:
	
	```plaintext
	grid = [
	  [0, 0, 0],
	  [0, 0, 0],
	  [0, 0, 0]
	]
	```
	
	#### Output:
	
	```plaintext
	0
	```
	
	#### Explanation:
	
	1. There are no land cells, so there are no islands.
	
	---
	
	### **Constraints**
	
	1. $1 \leq m, n \leq 300$
	2. `grid[i][j]` is either `0` (water) or `1` (land).
