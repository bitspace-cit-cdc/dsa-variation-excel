### Problem Statement:
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer. Additionally, after reversing the bits, ensure that no more than two consecutive 1's appear in the result. If this condition cannot be satisfied after reversal, return 0.

**Note:**
* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
* If the reversed bits contain more than two consecutive 1's, return 0.

Input:
- A 32-bit unsigned integer n

Output:
- A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the reversed bits if it satisfies the consecutive 1's constraint
- Return 0 if the constraint cannot be satisfied

Examples:
1)
```
Input: n = 43261596 (00000010100101000001111010011100)
Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: After reversing the bits, no more than two consecutive 1's appear in the result
```

2)
```
Input: n = 4294967293 (11111111111111111111111111111101)
Output: 0
Explanation: After reversing the bits would result in (10111111111111111111111111111111), which contains more than two consecutive 1's
```

3)
```
Input: n = 5 (00000000000000000000000000000101)
Output: 2684354560 (10100000000000000000000000000000)
Explanation: After reversing the bits, no more than two consecutive 1's appear in the result
```

### Constraints:
- The input must be a 32-bit unsigned integer
- The reversed result must not contain more than two consecutive 1's
- The time complexity should remain O(1)
- All 32 bits must be processed, including leading zeros
