## Problem Statement:
You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return *the resulting array of digits*. However, if after incrementing, any adjacent digits in the result have an absolute difference greater than 4, return the original array instead.

### Input:
- An array of integers representing digits of a large number

## Output:
- An array of integers representing the number after incrementing by one if adjacent digit constraint is met
- Original array if adjacent digit constraint is violated

## Examples:
1)
```
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: 
123 + 1 = 124
All adjacent digits differ by ≤ 4: |1-2| = 1, |2-4| = 2
```

2)
```
Input: digits = [4,3,9]
Output: [4,3,9]
Explanation:
439 + 1 would be 440
But |4-0| = 4 and |3-0| = 3 would create adjacent digits (3,0) with difference > 4
Return original array
```

3)
```
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation:
9 + 1 = 10
Adjacent digits |1-0| = 1 which is ≤ 4
```

4)
```
Input: digits = [8,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9]
Explanation:
899 + 1 would be 900
But |9-0| = 9 which violates adjacent digit constraint
Return original array
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ digits.length ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ digits[i] ≤ 9
- digits does not contain any leading 0's
- The absolute difference between any adjacent digits in result must not exceed 4
- If constraint is violated, return original array unchanged
- Solution should maintain the same space complexity as original problem
