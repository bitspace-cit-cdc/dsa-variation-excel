### Problem Statement:
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of operations required to convert* `word1` to `word2` with these rules:
* Insert a character (costs 2 units)
* Delete a character (costs 2 units)
* Replace a character (costs 3 units if replacing vowel with vowel or consonant with consonant, 4 units otherwise)
* Swap two adjacent characters (costs 1 unit)
* Add parentheses around any two adjacent characters (costs 1 unit)

Additional constraints:
1. The total cost must not exceed a given budget `k`
2. The final string must maintain the same count of vowels as `word2`
3. You cannot perform consecutive operations on the same position
4. Parentheses must be balanced in intermediate steps

---
### Input:
- String `word1` (source string)
- String `word2` (target string)
- Integer `k` (maximum budget)

### Output:
- Integer representing minimum cost of operations
- Return -1 if impossible within budget

Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "rose", k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: 
horse -> hrose (swap 'r' and 'o', cost 1)
hrose -> rose (delete 'h', cost 2)
Total cost = 3 < budget
Maintains vowel count (both have 2 vowels)
```

Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "cat", word2 = "cut", k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: 
Replacing 'a' with 'u' costs 4 units (vowel to vowel)
No other valid sequence of operations exists within budget 3
```

Example 3:
```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "(bc)a", k = 5
Output: 4
Explanation:
abc -> bac (swap, cost 1)
bac -> (bc)a (add parentheses and delete, cost 3)
Total cost = 4
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ word1.length, word2.length ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters and possibly '(' and ')'
- Total operations cost must not exceed k
- Must maintain same vowel count as target word
- Cannot perform consecutive operations at same position
- All intermediate strings must have balanced parentheses
- Each operation has its specific cost as defined above
