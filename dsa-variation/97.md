#  Problem Statement:

There are `n` cities connected by flights with varying carbon emissions and ticket prices. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei, emissionsi, timei]` indicating a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`, carbon emissions `emissionsi` (in kg CO2), and flight duration `timei` (in hours).
You are also given integers `src`, `dst`, `budget`, and `maxTime`. Find the route from `src` to `dst` that minimizes total carbon emissions while staying within the given `budget` and `maxTime`. The route must include at least one "green airport" (airports marked as eco-friendly in the `greenAirports` array).

---
### Input and Output:
- Input: 
  - `flights`: Array where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei, emissionsi, timei]`
  - `src`, `dst`: Source and destination cities
  - `budget`: Maximum total cost allowed
  - `maxTime`: Maximum total travel time allowed
  - `greenAirports`: Array of airport IDs that are eco-friendly
- Output: Array containing $[totalEmissions, path, totalCost, totalTime]$ for the most eco-friendly route, or $[-1]$ if no valid route exists

Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: 
flights = [
    [0,1,100,50,2],  // [from,to,price,emissions,time]
    [1,2,150,75,1],
    [0,2,300,100,3]
], 
src = 0, dst = 2, 
budget = 300,
maxTime = 4,
greenAirports = [1]
Output: [125, [0,1,2], 250, 3]
Explanation: Route 0->1->2 has lower emissions than direct 0->2,
includes green airport 1, costs 250, takes 3 hours

Example 2:
Input:
flights = [
    [0,1,200,80,2],
    [1,2,100,40,1],
    [2,3,150,60,2]
],
src = 0, dst = 3,
budget = 400,
maxTime = 3,
greenAirports = [2]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: No route possible within maxTime of 3 hours
```

- $1 ≤ budget ≤ 100000$
- $1 ≤ maxTime ≤ 72$
- greenAirports contains at least one valid airport ID
