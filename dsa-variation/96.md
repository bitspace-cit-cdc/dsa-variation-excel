## Problem Statement:

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents a space station in a 3D space network. The value represents the minimum energy shield level needed to safely pass through that point. You start with an initial shield strength of `S` units. Your shield regenerates by `R` units every time you move to an adjacent station, but takes damage equal to the difference if the station's required shield level is higher than your current shield. If your shield drops to 0 or below, you cannot proceed. You can move to a 4-directionally adjacent station in one move.
Return the path with minimum shield requirement `S` needed to reach the bottom right station `(n-1, n-1)` starting from `(0, 0)`, or return -1 if no path exists.

## Input and Output:
- **Input**: 
  - `grid`: n x n matrix of integers representing required shield levels
  - `R`: Shield regeneration rate per move
- **Output**: Integer representing minimum initial shield strength needed, and the path taken

### Examples:
```
Example 1:
Input: 
grid = [
    [1, 3, 5],
    [2, 4, 7],
    [3, 1, 2]
], R = 2
Output: [4, "DDRR"]
Explanation:
- Start with shield = 4
- Move down: shield = 4-2+2 = 4 (damage 2, regen 2)
- Move down: shield = 4-3+2 = 3 (damage 3, regen 2)
- Move right: shield = 3-1+2 = 4 (damage 1, regen 2)
- Move right: shield = 4-2+2 = 4 (damage 2, regen 2)

Example 2:
Input: 
grid = [
    [1, 8, 1],
    [2, 9, 3],
    [3, 4, 2]
], R = 1
Output: [8, "RRDD"]
```

### Constraints:
- $2 ≤ n ≤ 50$
- $1 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 100$
- $1 ≤ R ≤ 10$
- $grid[0][0] ≤ initial shield strength$
- The path must stay within grid boundaries
- Shield cannot go below 0 at any point
