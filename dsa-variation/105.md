### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find a subarray that has the largest product and contains exactly `k` negative numbers. Additionally, the subarray must include at least one even number. Return *the maximum product*. If no such subarray exists, return 0.

---
### Input:
- Integer array `nums` 
- Integer `k` representing the required count of negative numbers in the subarray

### Output:
- Integer representing the maximum product of a valid subarray
- Return 0 if no valid subarray exists

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4,-1], k = 2
Output: 48
Explanation: Subarray [2,3,-2,4,-1] contains exactly 2 negative numbers (-2 and -1) and includes even numbers (2,4).
The product is 2 * 3 * (-2) * 4 * (-1) = 48
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Any subarray containing exactly 1 negative number would not include an even number, so return 0
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,-2,3,-4,5], k = 2
Output: 120
Explanation: Subarray [1,-2,3,-4,5] has 2 negative numbers (-2,-4) and even numbers (-2,-4)
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 2 * 10⁴
- -10 ≤ nums\[i\] ≤ 10
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10
- The answer will fit in a 32-bit integer
- The subarray must be contiguous
- The subarray must contain exactly k negative numbers
- The subarray must contain at least one even number
- nums array will have at least one even number
