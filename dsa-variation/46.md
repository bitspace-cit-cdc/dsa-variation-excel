# Subsequence Matching

## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine whether `s2` contains `s1` as a subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Return `true` if `s1` is a subsequence of `s2`, or `false` otherwise.

## Constraints
- $1 \leq \text{s1.length}, \text{s2.length} \leq 10^4$
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Input
- A string `s1` representing the subsequence to check.
- A string `s2` representing the string to search for the subsequence.

## Output
- A boolean value indicating whether `s1` is a subsequence of `s2`.
  - Return `true` if `s1` is a subsequence of `s2`.
  - Return `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**:
- s1 = "abc"
- s2 = "ahbgdc"

**Output**:
- true

**Explanation**:
- "abc" is a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because we can obtain "abc" by deleting the characters 'h', 'g', and 'd' from "ahbgdc" without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Example 2
**Input**:
- s1 = "axc"
- s2 = "ahbgdc"

**Output**:
- false

**Explanation**:
- "axc" is not a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because there is no 'x' character between 'a' and 'c' in "ahbgdc".

### Example 3
**Input**:
- s1 = "acb"
- s2 = "ahbgdc"

**Output**:
- false

**Explanation**:
- "acb" is not a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because the characters 'a', 'c', and 'b' do not appear in the same order in "ahbgdc".

### Solution

#### Python Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s1) and j < len(s2):
            if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1
        return i == len(s1)

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for _ in range(int(input())):
	    s1 = input()
	    s2 = input()
	    solution = Solution()
	    print(solution.isSubsequence(s1, s2))
```

#### C++ Implementation
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(const string& s1, const string& s2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s1.length() && j < s2.length()) {
            if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == s1.length();
    }
};

int main() {
    string s1, s2;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;

    Solution solution;
    cout << (solution.isSubsequence(s1, s2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
