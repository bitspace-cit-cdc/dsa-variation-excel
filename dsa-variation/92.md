### **Problem Statement**

You are given a connected **undirected graph** that was originally a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. However, an additional edge was added to the tree, creating a cycle.

The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. Your task is to **find and remove one edge** to break the cycle and restore the graph to a tree.

If there are multiple edges that can be removed to achieve this, return the edge that **appears last** in the input list.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[2, 3]
```

**Explanation:**

- The input graph contains a cycle: `[1, 2] -> [2, 3] -> [1, 3]`.
- Removing the edge `[2, 3]` restores the graph to a tree.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 4], [1, 5]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[1, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

- The input graph contains a cycle: `[1, 2] -> [2, 3] -> [3, 4] -> [1, 4]`.
- Removing the edge `[1, 4]` restores the graph to a tree.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**

```plaintext
edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[3, 1]
```

**Explanation:**

- The graph contains a single cycle: `[1, 2] -> [2, 3] -> [3, 1]`.
- Removing the edge `[3, 1]` restores the graph to a tree.

### **Constraints**

1. $3 \leq n \leq 1000$
2. `edges.length == n`
3. `edges[i].length == 2`
4. $1 \leq ai, bi \leq n$
5. Each pair `[ai, bi]` represents a unique edge in the graph except for the one added edge that creates the cycle.
6. The input graph is guaranteed to contain exactly one cycle.
