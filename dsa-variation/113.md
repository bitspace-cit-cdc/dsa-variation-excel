### Problem Statement:
Given an `m x n` integers `matrix` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest path in* `matrix` that satisfies these conditions:
1. Each value in the path must be a prime number
2. The difference between consecutive numbers in the path must be exactly `k`
3. You can move in eight directions (including diagonals) if current number is even, but only four directions (up, down, left, right) if current number is odd
4. Path cannot cross itself (cannot reuse cells)
5. Must visit at least one cell from each row

### Input:
- 2D integer array `matrix`
- Integer `k` representing required difference between consecutive numbers

### Output:
- Integer representing length of longest valid path

### Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[2,7,13],
                 [5,11,17],
                 [3,19,23]], k = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Path [7,13,19] is valid because:
- All numbers are prime
- Differences are 6 (13-7) and 6 (19-13)
- 7 is odd so used non-diagonal move to 13
- 13 is odd so used non-diagonal move to 19
- Visits one cell from each row
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[4,8,12],
                 [6,10,14],
                 [8,12,16]], k = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: No valid path exists as no cells contain prime numbers
```

Example 3:
```
Input: matrix = [[2,3,7],
                 [5,11,13],
                 [19,23,29]], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: No valid path exists with difference exactly 2 between consecutive primes
```

Constraints:
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix\[i\].length
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 200
- 0 ≤ matrix\[i\]\[j\] ≤ 200
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 100
- Path must only contain prime numbers
- Consecutive numbers must differ by exactly k
- Can move in 8 directions from even numbers
- Can move in 4 directions from odd numbers
- Must visit at least one cell from each row
- Cannot reuse cells in the path
