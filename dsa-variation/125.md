# Problem Statement:
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. However, if any two adjacent digits in the reversed number have a difference greater than 5, return 0. Additionally, if reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range $[-2^{31}, 2^{31} - 1]$, then return `0`.
**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

### Input:
- A signed 32-bit integer x

### Output:
- The reversed integer if it's within the range and satisfies the adjacent digits constraint
- 0 if the result exceeds the range or if any adjacent digits in the reversed number differ by more than 5

### Examples:
1)
```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Explanation:
Reversed number is 321
Adjacent digits: |3-2| = 1, |2-1| = 1
All differences are ≤ 5
```

2)
```
Input: x = 147
Output: 0
Explanation:
Would reverse to 741
Adjacent digits: |7-4| = 3, |4-1| = 3
But |7-1| = 6 which is > 5
```

3)
```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Explanation:
Reversed number is -321
Adjacent digits: |3-2| = 1, |2-1| = 1
All differences are ≤ 5
```

4)
```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
Explanation:
Reversed number is 21
Adjacent digits: |2-1| = 1
All differences are ≤ 5
```

### Constraints:
- -2³¹ ≤ x ≤ 2³¹ - 1
- The absolute difference between any two adjacent digits in the reversed number must not exceed 5
- Environment does not allow storing 64-bit integers
- The solution should handle negative numbers
- Leading zeros should be removed in the output
